# Creation_of_friends_location_map_application

My website was created on pythonanywhere


1)The second task

:one: The python program is created to help the user navigate in JSON file

:two: My program shows the user the object and available key/index for the next step


                                                        The user has two options here:

:crocodile:  following the instructions of my program                                                                            

:sauropod:   write "exit" to finish
                                                              
                                                              
                                                              
                                                            
                                                        The pros of my program are:
 :diamonds:  in case of wrong key or index, doesn't crash
 
 :diamonds:  can help you to get the correct value
 
 :diamonds:  works recursively
